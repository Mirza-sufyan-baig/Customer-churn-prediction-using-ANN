# Customer-churn-prediction-using-ANN

This project is a **Streamlit-based web application** that predicts the probability of a customer churning (leaving) based on their demographic and account information.  
It uses a **pre-trained TensorFlow/Keras model** along with **saved encoders and a scaler** for preprocessing.
